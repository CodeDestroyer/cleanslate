About this project
-------------------

Dharmafly Docs is a Github Pages templating system. It allows project members to create a website for their Dharmafly projects.


About this branch
-----------------

This is the development branch. If you're looking to create a website for your Dharmafly project, see the main [README] (https://github.com/dharmafly/dharmafly-docs)

If you're looking to update the general Dharmafly Docs template, carry out all development work on Dharmafly Docs in this branch.

This branch is also the working code for the [Dharmafly Docs project website] (http://dharmafly.github.com/dharmafly-docs/), which contains the styleguide.

The [`master` branch] (https://github.com/dharmafly/dharmafly-docs) contains an empty template, reflecting the latest code and should be used by project developers to generate new project websites.

How Can I set up a new Dharmafly project website?

Full documentation can be found on the main [README] (https://github.com/dharmafly/dharmafly-docs#https://github.com/dharmafly/dharmafly-docs#how-can-i-set-up-a-new-dharmafly-project-website)

Getting started
===================

How do I update the Dharmafly Docs project itself?
--------------------------------------

This is the development branch, you should carry out all work in this branch. 

Once pushed to this branch (`git push origin gh-pages`), Github will automatically regenerate the [Dharmafly Docs project website] (http://dharmafly.github.com/dharmafly-docs/).

To update the [`master` branch] (https://github.com/dharmafly/dharmafly-docs), switch to the master branch (`git checkout master`), then pull the changes made in this branch (`git pull origin gh-pages`). This will result in a merge conflict with the `README.md` (as the content on the `master` branch is different to this README). The temporary fix for this is to copy the current `master` README from https://github.com/dharmafly/dharmafly-docs/blob/master/README.md and then `add`, `commit` and `push`.

The site structure
------------------------

The main frameworks (`<head>`,`<body>` tags, and so on) are within the `_layouts` folder. The `default.html` layout is used currently on all pages.

This contains a liquid tag for the variable `{{ content }}`, a liquid reserved word, used for the content of 'this' page. So if the user has gone to the site home page, then `index.html` will be the `content`. If you've gone to `/reference/`, then `/reference/index.html` will be the `content`

### Creating new themes / colour schemes

Blocks of code in posts

### Code highlighting themes

### Allowing users to edit code inline

Responsive design

### Breakpoints

### Scrolling

### Resizing

### The subnav

The subnav is shown by default. If the user resizes the screen to a size where the width of the widest link in the subnav is pushed off-screen, then two things happen: the subnav is set `.off-left` and the `.show-subnav` icon is shown in the navigation. Additionally, the subnav is hidden.

If the user clicks on the show subnav icon, then the subnav is set `off-left show-nav`. So it's technically off screen but visible, as the `.content` area's left position is set to a position based on the width of the subnav.

The animation is done by css transforms set on certain properties of those classes.
